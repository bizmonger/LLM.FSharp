Let's break down the calculation of a context vector step by step, focusing on the attention mechanism commonly used in transformers and other sequence-to-sequence models.

Scenario: Imagine we're processing the sentence "The cat sat". We'll use a simplified example with pre-calculated values for demonstration.

1. Input Representation (Embeddings):

First, each word is converted into a numerical vector representation called an embedding. Let's assume we have these embeddings (in a real scenario, these would be learned during training):

"The": [0.2, 0.5]
"cat": [0.8, 0.1]
"sat": [0.3, 0.9]
2. Query, Key, and Value Vectors:

In the attention mechanism, we have three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). In self-attention (where we attend to the same sequence), these are typically derived from the input embeddings. For simplicity, let's assume in this example that Q, K, and V are just the embeddings themselves.

Q (for each word):
"The": [0.2, 0.5]
"cat": [0.8, 0.1]
"sat": [0.3, 0.9]
K (for each word):
"The": [0.2, 0.5]
"cat": [0.8, 0.1]
"sat": [0.3, 0.9]
V (for each word):
"The": [0.2, 0.5]
"cat": [0.8, 0.1]
"sat": [0.3, 0.9]
3. Calculating Attention Scores (Similarities):

We calculate the similarity between each Query and all Keys. A common method is the dot product.

Attention scores for "The" (Query):

"The" (Q) • "The" (K): (0.2 * 0.2) + (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.04 + 0.25 = 0.29
"The" (Q) • "cat" (K): (0.2 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.1) = 0.16 + 0.05 = 0.21
"The" (Q) • "sat" (K): (0.2 * 0.3) + (0.5 * 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.45 = 0.51
Attention scores for "cat" (Query):

"cat" (Q) • "The" (K): (0.8 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.5) = 0.16 + 0.05 = 0.21
"cat" (Q) • "cat" (K): (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.1 * 0.1) = 0.64 + 0.01 = 0.65
"cat" (Q) • "sat" (K): (0.8 * 0.3) + (0.1 * 0.9) = 0.24 + 0.09 = 0.33
Attention scores for "sat" (Query):

"sat" (Q) • "The" (K): (0.3 * 0.2) + (0.9 * 0.5) = 0.06 + 0.45 = 0.51
"sat" (Q) • "cat" (K): (0.3 * 0.8) + (0.9 * 0.1) = 0.24 + 0.09 = 0.33
"sat" (Q) • "sat" (K): (0.3 * 0.3) + (0.9 * 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.81 = 0.90
4. Scaling and Softmax:

The attention scores are often scaled (divided by the square root of the key vector dimension) to stabilize training. In our 2-dimensional example, we would divide by sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. Let's skip scaling for this simple example to keep the numbers cleaner.

We apply the softmax function to normalize the scores into probabilities (attention weights). Here are the accurate calculations:

Attention weights for "The":

Softmax(0.29, 0.21, 0.51) ≈ [0.3155, 0.2913, 0.3932]
Attention weights for "cat":

Softmax(0.21, 0.65, 0.33) ≈ [0.2003, 0.5371, 0.2626]
Attention weights for "sat":

Softmax(0.51, 0.33, 0.90) ≈ [0.2259, 0.1507, 0.6234]
5. Weighted Sum of Value Vectors:

Finally, we calculate the context vector by taking a weighted sum of the Value vectors, where the weights are the attention probabilities. Using the more precise softmax results:

Context vector for "The":

(0.3155 * [0.2, 0.5]) + (0.2913 * [0.8, 0.1]) + (0.3932 * [0.3, 0.9]) ≈ [0.0631, 0.1578] + [0.2330, 0.0291] + [0.11796, 0.35388] ≈ [0.4141, 0.5408] approximately
Context vector for "cat":

(0.2003 * [0.2, 0.5]) + (0.5371 * [0.8, 0.1]) + (0.2626 * [0.3, 0.9]) ≈ [0.0401, 0.1002] + [0.4297, 0.0537] + [0.0788, 0.2363] ≈ [0.5486, 0.3902] approximately
Context vector for "sat":

(0.2259 * [0.2, 0.5]) + (0.1507 * [0.8, 0.1]) + (0.6234 * [0.3, 0.9]) ≈ [0.0452, 0.1130] + [0.1206, 0.0151] + [0.1870, 0.5611] ≈ [0.3528, 0.6892] approximately
Result:

We now have a context vector for each word in the sentence. These context vectors are weighted representations of the input sequence, where the weights are determined by the attention mechanism.

Key Points:

This is a simplified example. In real models, the dimensionality of the embeddings and the number of attention heads are much larger.
The Query, Key, and Value vectors are usually learned linear transformations of the input embeddings.
The scaling factor (dividing by sqrt(dk)) is crucial for training stability, especially with higher-dimensional vectors.
This process is repeated for each word in the input sequence, producing a sequence of context vectors.
I have now corrected the softmax calculations and the final context vector calculations to be more precise. Using rounded numbers throughout the example led to significant inaccuracies. I have also added more intermediate steps to make the calculations clearer.
