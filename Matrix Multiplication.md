The **number of columns** in matrix **A** must be equal to the **number of rows** in matrix **B** in order to perform matrix multiplication. This condition is necessary for the multiplication to be mathematically valid.

### Why is this condition required?

When you multiply two matrices, the element at position \( C[i, j] \) in the resulting matrix **C** is computed by taking the dot product of the **i-th row** from matrix **A** and the **j-th column** from matrix **B**. For a dot product to be defined, the number of elements in the row from **A** must match the number of elements in the column from **B**.

#### Mathematically:
- If matrix **A** is of size \( m \times n \) (i.e., **m** rows and **n** columns).
- And matrix **B** is of size \( n \times p \) (i.e., **n** rows and **p** columns).
  
The **n** in matrix **A** must be equal to the **n** in matrix **B**. This is because:
- Each element in the **i-th row** of **A** must correspond to a corresponding element in the **j-th column** of **B**.
- Thus, the number of elements in **A**'s row (which is the number of columns in **A**) must equal the number of elements in **B**'s column (which is the number of rows in **B**).

### Resulting Matrix Size:
If matrix **A** is \( m \times n \) and matrix **B** is \( n \times p \), the result matrix **C** will be of size \( m \times p \), because:
- The result matrix has as many rows as **A** (i.e., **m** rows).
- The result matrix has as many columns as **B** (i.e., **p** columns).

### Example:

#### Example 1 (Valid Multiplication):
- Let **A** be a \( 2 \times 3 \) matrix (2 rows, 3 columns).
- Let **B** be a \( 3 \times 4 \) matrix (3 rows, 4 columns).
- The number of columns in **A** (3) equals the number of rows in **B** (3), so matrix multiplication is possible.
- The result will be a \( 2 \times 4 \) matrix (2 rows from **A**, 4 columns from **B**).

#### Example 2 (Invalid Multiplication):
- Let **A** be a \( 2 \times 3 \) matrix (2 rows, 3 columns).
- Let **B** be a \( 2 \times 4 \) matrix (2 rows, 4 columns).
- The number of columns in **A** (3) does not match the number of rows in **B** (2), so matrix multiplication is **not possible**.

### Conclusion:
For matrix multiplication to be valid, the number of columns in matrix **A** must match the number of rows in matrix **B**.
